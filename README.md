# SMB-TASTools
TASing productivity lua script for SMB1/2J. If you are just getting into TASing and do not have a good grasp on the mechanics I DO NOT recommend you use this script. Take the time to thoroughly learn the game mechanics first.

Currently has a preset-based subpixel manipulator, a ground accel lookup, a subspeed searcher, and airborne state seeker. It also displays remainders at the end of levels (note that it displays the true remainder in warp zones).
